# Computational Thinking WS2022

This repository contains the student notebooks (practice, homework, and others) for the course **Computational Thinking** for the winter semester 2022.

These notebooks (without solutions) should be publicly available for all students such that we can use the [ngitpuller link generator](https://jupyterhub.github.io/nbgitpuller/link.html).

This repo is mirrowed.
